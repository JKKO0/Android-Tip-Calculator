# Android-Tip-Calculator
I developed an Android Tip Calculator application using Android Studio and Kotlin, aimed at simplifying the process of calculating tips and splitting bills among friends and diners. This project demonstrates my proficiency in mobile app development, user interface design, and data processing.
Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface: The app features a clean and intuitive user interface created using XML layouts. Users can easily input the base amount, select a tip percentage using a SeekBar, and specify the number of people sharing the bill.
Dynamic Tip Calculation: The app dynamically calculates the tip and total amount as the user enters the base amount and adjusts the tip percentage. This real-time feedback enhances the user experience and ensures accuracy in bill splitting.
Tip Percentage Animation: To engage users and provide visual feedback, the app includes an animated tip percentage display. As the user slides the SeekBar to adjust the tip percentage, the percentage value animates for a more interactive experience.
Bill Splitting: The application divides the total bill (including tip) by the number of people specified, providing each person's share of the bill. This feature simplifies the process of splitting expenses among a group.
